                <div class="ans"><strong>Global Scope: </strong><br>Global scope is declared outside the function. If it
                    is not initialized zero is stored as default. Data sharing is possible as multiple functions can
                    access the same global variable. You can access global variables by any statement in the
                    program.When the value of the global variable is modified in one function changes are visible in the
                    rest of the program.<br><strong>Block Scope: </strong><br>Bloack scope is declared inside a
                    function. If it is not initialized, a garbage value is stored. It is created when the function
                    starts execution and lost when the functions terminate. Data sharing is not possible as data of the
                    local variable can be accessed by only one function. Local variables can be accessed with the help
                    of statements, inside a function in which they are declared.

                <div class="ans">The<strong> Event Loop </strong>is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be
                    clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the
                    event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes
                    it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.
